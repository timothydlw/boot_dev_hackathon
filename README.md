Here is my submission for the Boot.dev July 2025 Hackathon. I made a calorie and macronutrient calculator that calculates recommended daily calories, and splits those calories into recommended protein, carbs, and fats amounts per day.

I attached standalone executables for Linux and MacOS.

To use the app:

1. Download the zip
2. Extract the zip
3. Open a terminal
4. cd to the file it's saved in
5. Run the command ./main_calorie_linux.zip or ./main_calorie_macos.zip depending on your OS
6. Follow the prompts got generate your recommended calories and macronutrients

**If you run it on MacOS and nothing happens after you run the app, resizing the window should help**
